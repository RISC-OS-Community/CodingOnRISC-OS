# RISC OS Coding Zoom Meetings

As part of the effort in this repo we are also trying to organize a set of zoom meetings for people to share, discuss, present:

* How-To coding on RISC OS in various programming languages
* How-To use tools and utilities to help programming workflows
* Share personal workflows used to produce software for RISC OS
* Explore possibilities and methodologies
* Analyze existing code (where licensing allow this!)
* Present solutions to problems from a coding perspective
* Produce mini programming courses to help beginners to learn more

## Meetings organization

Each meeting is:

* organized in 2 parts
  * 1st part (beginners) dedicated to learn how to code on RISC OS (presentations from various community members on how to code on RO in various languages)
  * 2nd part (advanced) dedicated to people to share their code, techniques, workflows etc. Everyone can take the mic here and share what we are working on and present projects (please note: it’s a coding meeting, so code needs to be showed! it’s not about selling things!), we can also go “round table” and everyone can share their progress and struggles in their coding journey/project.

Meetings are recorded.

Recordings will be split too, so people willing to watch on YouTube will have an easy life to find what they need.

Meetings are informal. So, no need to prepare ultra-professional presentations, however using slides and diagrams to explain concepts is welcome and we recommend to ensure always to show code in a "show and tell" form.

Presentations can be pre-recorded to help the presenter or to make it easy to show processes that may take long time, however, in these cases, we'd recommend the presenter to also be in the live meeting for the Q&A session at the end of their presentation.

Meetings should take place once a month. Dates and time are being worked on at the moment.

## How can I present?

It's very simple, just let us know what you'd like to present and give us an ideas of the time it will take you to be ready with your material, so we can schedule your presentation on the meetings' calendar.

Ensure you have equipment to share your slides and code (doesn't necessarily needs to be live-code running on a system).
Where a presentation is on a methodology and has no code, it's ok not to have code to share, but again if you need to present a product to a general audience then we'd recommend to use RISC OS general meetings which are organised quite often by all the various RISC OS clubs in UK and EU. Meetings here are to share coding knowledge and methodologies to solve problems, not to sell products.

## How can I request a meeting subject?

At the moment the discussion is on the ROOL forum [here](https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/17493?page=1). However, given that a forum topic is hard to track over a long period of time, we recommend to use "Issues" menu here on GitHub at the top to open a "feature request".

## Types of subjects so far

Have a look [here](RISCOSCodingMeetingsIdeas.md) for a detailed list of meeting subjects already requested.
