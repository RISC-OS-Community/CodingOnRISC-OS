# RISC OS Coding Resources

What follow is a list of resources organised by programming language. There is also a list of generic info for everyone who needs an introduction to programming in general (aka who has no idea of how to code at all).

## Programming in C++ on RISC OS

At this time ROOL DDE is still based on the original AT&T CFront release 3.0 (they just added few fixes here and there), While RISC OS 5 also has GCC 4.7.4 which supports up to early C++11 (not complete and exceptions do not work well on RISC OS). If you are after more modern C++ standards please have a look at the GCCSDK project.
