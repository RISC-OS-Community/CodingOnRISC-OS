# RISC OS Coding Resources

What follow is a list of resources organised by programming language. There is also a list of generic info for everyone who needs an introduction to programming in general (aka who has no idea of how to code at all).

## Introduction to programming

### Introduction to computer programming

This section is for absolute beginners and we list a set of useful resources (in order of from absolute 0 to some degree of knowledge) to help everyone who have no basic knowledge of computer programming in general.
