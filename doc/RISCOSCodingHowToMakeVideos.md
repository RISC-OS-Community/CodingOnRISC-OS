# How to make videos for RISC OS Community YouTube channel

## Introduction

This document is intended to provide some guidelines and suggestions on how to make videos for the RISC OS Community YouTube channel.

On the YouTube channel we release videos with the CC License, so please make sure you understand this and accept it before you submit your video, thank you.

## General guidelines

### Video Format

Unless otherwise agreed with the RISC OS Community team, the following guidelines should be followed:

* Videos should be in English language. If you want to make videos in other languages, please contact the RISC OS Community team. We may be able to provide subtitles in English.
* Videos should be recorded in 1080p (1920x1080) resolution.
* Videos should be recorded in 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Videos should be recorded in 60fps.
* Videos should be recorded in MP4 format.
* Videos should be recorded in H.264 codec.
* Videos should be recorded in AAC audio codec.
* Videos should be recorded in stereo audio. Microphone are usually mono, but the video recording software should take care of this automatically.
* Videos should be recorded in 48kHz audio sample rate.

### Video content

Unless otherwise agreed with the RISC OS Community team, the following guidelines should be followed:

* Videos should be related to RISC OS either coding on or for RISC OS or using RISC OS. If you want some ideas to work on please check the [Ideas and suggestions for mini courses](doc/RISCOSCodingVideosIdeas.md) document.
* If you want to make a video about your own project, please contact the RISC OS Community team first. Also make sure your project is Open Source and, possibly, available (publicly) on GitHub. The reason to restrict videos to Open SOurce projects is to avoid any potential legal issues (so it's not negotiable, sorry!).
* Videos should be as short as possible. If you have a lot of content to show, please consider splitting it into multiple videos.
* Videos should be as simple as possible. Please avoid using technical terms or jargon unless strictly necessary. If you have to use technical terms or jargon, please explain them in simple terms and/or provide links to publicly available resources (like Wikipedia for example) that explains such concepts in clear terms.
* You should record just the screen of your computer. Please avoid recording yourself or other people. We do not assume any responsibility for any potential legal issues that may arise from recording people without their explicit consent and/or privacy breaching coming from showing people on cameras etc.

#### Video Content restrictions

* Videos should be friendly and welcoming to everyone. Please avoid any kind of offensive language or behavior.
* You should not record any copyrighted content. Our videos will always be freely available and provided under [YouTube CC license (Creative Common license)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en-GB).
* Your videos should be as impartial as possible. Please avoid trying to promote any specific product or service. It's our strong believe that we should show only technical content and let the viewer decide what to use and what not to use. It's wonderful to be enthusiastic about a product or service, but please avoid trying to convince the viewer to use it. Also please avoid trying to convince the viewer to not use a specific product or service.
* You should not record any content that may be considered potentially illegal, offensive or inappropriate. Please avoid showing any kind of offensive or inappropriate content on your screen as well. If you are not sure about what is considered offensive or inappropriate, please contact the RISC OS Community team. Also please consider reading our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Our videos are available world wide, so please make sure your content is suitable for everyone.
* Please ensure that your video remains focused on the technical content and refrains from featuring any political, religious or offensive material. This includes any content that could be discriminatory or harmful to any age, gender, LGBT+ individuals and other minority groups or ethnicity. If you are unsure about what may be considered inappropriate, please consult the RISC OS Community team. Additionally, we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more detailed guidance.
* Please understand that we will not publish any video containing material that doesn't meet the above guidelines and doesn't respect our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Video recording

If you're not experienced with video recording, there are a number of things you should consider:

1) Video capturing, this is a technique to record the screen of your computer. There are a number of ways you can do this, please check the [Video Capturing](#video-capturing) section below for more details.
2) Audio capturing, this is a technique to record the audio from your microphone. There are a number of ways you can do this, please check the [Microphone](#microphone) section below for more details.
3) When recording your videos, you may wish to follow a "script" to make sure you don't forget anything. This is not strictly necessary, but it may help you to make sure you don't forget anything. Also, if you're not experienced with video recording, it may help you to feel more confident. Please check the [Script](#script) section below for more details.
4) Each video should NOT be shorter than 5 minutes and should NOT be longer than 15 minutes (average length should be around 10 minutes). If you have a lot of content to show, please consider splitting it into multiple videos or consider making a series of videos. Please check the [Series](#series) section below for more details. If a single video requires a lot of details, then please consider contacting us to let us know you wish to record an "In-Depth" video. Please check the [In-Depth](#in-depth) section below for more details.
5) Please make sure your screen is clean and tidy. Please avoid showing any kind of personal information on your screen. Please check the [Screen](#screen) section below for more details. Avoid also showing passwords and such. If you can't avoid that, then don't worry, we can always black-out that part of the video during editing.
6) Please note (only for coding videos), your code will have to be received with an Open Source license that allow us to upload and store it in [this](https://github.com/RISC-OS-Community/CodingOnRISC-OS) repository for users to use and read. Please check the [Code](#code) section below for more details.

Other useful tips:

* Please make sure your screen is clean and tidy. Please avoid showing any kind of personal information on your screen.
* Please make sure your screen is not too bright or too dark.
* Please make sure your microphone is not too close or too far from your mouth.
* Please make sure your microphone is not too loud or too quiet. In editing we can fix the volume, but we can't fix distortion.
* Please make sure your microphone is not too close to your computer. If you have a laptop, please make sure your microphone is not too close to the fan.
* Please try not to open too many windows during your video recording. If you have to open a lot of windows, please consider closing them, so that the viewer can always focus on what it truly important for learning.

To record your videos there are a number of ways you can use. The following are just some suggestions:

### Video Capturing

This is where most of the work of making videos for our channel focus on. Showing how to use a tool or a technique and record the computer screen while doing so.

There are a number of ways you can do this, but the most common are:

1) Using an hardware device to record the screen. Please check the [Video Capturing](#video-capturing) section below for more details.
2) Using an emulator to record the screen. When using an EMulator, all you'll need is a recording software. Please check the [Recording software](#recording-software) section below for more details.

### How to record a video

If it helps you, divide your video in multiple takes (or chapters). In other words, divide your content into multiple parts and record each part separately. This way you can focus on a single part at a time and you can make sure you don't forget anything. Also, if you make a mistake, you can simply re-record that part without having to re-record the whole video.

We'll recombine them together in a single video, for you during the editing phase that we do, you don't have to do this, so, no worries.

if you make a single take, please leave few seconds of silence between each chapter so we have enough "dead" time to add "chapter labels" (tiles) and transition effects when editing. 5 seconds should be enough, thx.

Ideally each video should be provided in mp4 format, but we can also translate multiple formats, just make sure you do not compress your video(s) too much to make them lose video and audio quality. If in doubt, ask us for a specific format, thx.

#### Intro

Each video should always start with a quick intro of what you're planning to show and the intro may contain the following information:

* Quick introduction to the topic of the video
* List of requirements (if any)
* List of assumptions (if any)
* List of prerequisites (if any)

On top of that don't forget to provide us with a list of links to resources (if any) (please make sure they are publicly available), these should be:

* Links to the software you're going to use (if any)
* Links to the hardware you're going to use (if any)
* Links to the code you're going to show (if any)
* Links to the documentation you're going to show (if any)

#### Outro

Each video should always end with a quick outro of what you have shown and the outro may contain the following information:

* Quick summary of what you have shown

The outro section is not a must, but it may help the viewer to remember what you have shown.

#### Chapters between Intro and Outro

Between the intro and the outro, you may have multiple chapters. Each chapter should be focused on a single topic and should be as short as possible. If you have a lot of content to show, please consider splitting it into multiple videos or consider making a series of videos.

### Screen

We have observed best results when recording a screen set to 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) and recording it by setting your capture card to 1080p (HD or 1920x1080). This way the fonts are larger and more readable on mobile devices (at this time we have a rate of views from mobile devices of ~ 30%).

If you're using an emulator, please make sure you're using the latest version of the emulator and that you're using the default settings. This way the viewer will be able to follow the video and learn from it.

Please don't use too high resolution screens, because the fonts may be too small to read. Try to remember that in this day and age a lot of people will use mobile devices to consume your videos, so please make sure the fonts are large enough to be readable on mobile devices.

Please avoid JPEG images as background for your RISC OS desktop, because they slow down windows redraw. Also avoid too rich backgrounds, because they may distract the viewer from the content of your video.

If possible, also avoid too many icons on the RISC OS pinboard (and iconbar), because they may distract the viewer from the content of your video or making it confusing for some novice users.

### Script

A script can be as simple as a bullet list of things you want to show in your video. This is not strictly necessary, but it may help you to make sure you don't forget anything. Also, if you're not experienced with video recording, it may help you to feel more confident.

If instead you prefer a more elaborate script, then you may consider writing a "transcript" for your video where you also organize each phrase you'll be saying in each chapter.

It's totally ok to use old releases of RISC OS (no need to focus only on RO 5, all RO releases are welcome!).

Each video should come with a transcript of the audio. This is to make sure that the video will be accessible to everyone, including people with hearing disabilities. Also, this will help us to translate the video in other languages. However, given that this activity may be time consuming, we have been working to add AI capabilities to this community and we are now able to generate transcripts automatically and fully synchronized for you, so we no longer need you to provide a transcript of your video.

On top of that we also have added AI capabilities to have transcripts synchronized translation in other languages, although such a feature is still in alpha testing.

### Series

If you have a lot of content to show, please consider splitting it into multiple videos or consider making a series of videos. This way the viewer will be able to follow the series and learn from it, without having to learn a different approach for each video.

Remember, in most cases viewer attention span is very short, so please try to keep your videos as short as possible. We have observed that the best length for a video is between 5 and 15 minutes (max).

There is an exception to the above rule for the "In-Depth" videos (see below). But such a videos are meant for a very technical audience which is already familiar with the topic of the video and is seeking for more details and more technical information.

### In-Depth

If a single video requires a lot of details, then please consider contacting us to let us know you wish to record an "In-Depth" video. This way we can make sure the viewer will be able to follow the video and learn from it.

"In-depth" videos are usually longer than 15 minutes, so please make sure you have enough content to show. Also, please make sure you have enough time to record the video.

Normally we would like to avoid having too many "In-Depth" videos, so please consider splitting your video into multiple videos or consider making a series of videos.

### Video Editing

You do NOT need to edit your videos, we'll do that for you. So please refrain yourself from editing your videos, this is because we have our internat standards on title, captioning, graphics, styling etc.

We want all our videos to have the same look and feel, so please refrain yourself from editing your videos, we'll do that for you.

### Code

What follow is a list of requirement for code that is going to be shown on the videos. If you're planning to make coding videos, please read this section carefully.

#### Code license

Every program and code showed in every video must be provided with an Open Source license that allow us to upload and store it in this repository for users to use and read.

The reason for this is that we want to make sure that every video will be useful for everyone, so if you show a program or a code snippet, we want to make sure that people will be able to use it and learn from it.

Copyleft licenses are preferred, but not mandatory. If you're not sure which license to use, please consider using the MIT license.

#### Coding series

Coding Series are a pre-defined set of episode and learning process for which every video creator will have to follow the same steps and the same approach. This is to make sure that the viewer will be able to follow the series and learn from it, without having to learn a different approach for each video.

If possible, lets share how we are going to solve the problem, so that everyone can use a very similar approach. This may sound a bit bizarre, but the idea is to focus on the specific of coding on RISC OS, not on solving the problem in different ways. This way, when watching the series, people will focus on such differences instead of trying to understand all the different approaches we used to solve the same problem (hope this makes sense).

This has been really effective with the git series, because we where all using git clone / git add / git commit and git push, so at the end of all the videos, people were well aware of those things (repetita iuvant!), while each video showed the differences between each approach.
