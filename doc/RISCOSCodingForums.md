# RISC OS coding forums

Here is a list of RISC OS related Forums where to ask for help with programming issues:

* ROOL Forum (RISC OS Open Forum)
  * [Community Support](https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11)
  * [Code Reviews](https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/3)

* StarDot Forums
  * [Programming](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=54), unfortunately stardot mixes together RISC OS and older Acorn platforms, so this forum may appear confusing, however there are good information
  * [32-bit Acorn software](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=29), another useful resource which (again) is a bit mixed up between people's programs and traditional commercial applications for RISC OS

* Google Groups
  * [Sys.Acorn.Programmer](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.acorn.programmer), good resource of info and place to ask coding and programming related questions

* Acorn.de (German forum, in English language)
  * doesn't appear to have a programming section

Other non active resources

* Cloverleaf RISC OS Developer Forum
  * [RISC OS Dev forum](https://www.riscosdevforum.com/), it seems to have only few posts mostly from Cloverleaf themselves, but it has a useful section on how to recompile GCC 10 for the GCCSDK project, which can be very useful
