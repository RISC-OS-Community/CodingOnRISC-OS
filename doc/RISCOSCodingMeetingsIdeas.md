# Everything coding on RISC OS meetings ideas

This document collects all the proposed ideas for the zoom meetings.

Each zoom meeting is divided in two parts:

1) Beginners
2) Advanced

In the beginner part we provide presentation and Q&A sections for whoever is learning how to code on RISC OS. 
In the advanced part more advanced presentation and coding discussions take place. Also the advanced part has a Q&A section at the end, in case it's a presentation.
