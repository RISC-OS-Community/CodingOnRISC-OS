# Everything Coding on RISC OS

This repository contains and organize all the resources we are aware of to share and provides info to learn and/or improve how to code on RISC OS and ARM platform.

For the Github experience people this repo is the equivalent of the many "awesome-resources" repo for other OS/platforms/languages. So please feel free to add what you think would make it better!

## Repository organization

The repository is organised in multiple levels:

* [Resources List](doc/RISCOSCodingResources.md)
* [Ideas](doc/RISCOSCodingMeetingsIdeas.md) for meetings (we provide Zoom based monthly meetings with presentations on everything coding on RISC OS)
* [Forums](doc/RISCOSCodingForums.md) where to ask questions related to code on RISC OS
* [RISC OS Coding meetings](doc/RISCOSCodingMeetings.md) material

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to help us to improve the resources list and have more ideas for the meetings as well as let us know if you're willing to commit to provide courses, presentations and/or sharing your experience of coding on RISC OS.

### How to contribute

Follow the general instructions [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) and update the docs in `doc` directories as you feel appropriate. When done request a `Pull Reuqest` so we can review your changes and approve them, thanks!

Enjoy! :)
