# Everything Coding on RISC OS

This repository contains and organize all the resources we are aware of to share and provides info to learn and/or improve how to code on RISC OS and ARM platform.

For Github experienced people, this repo is the equivalent of the many "awesome-resources" repo for other OS/platforms/languages. So please feel free to add what you think would make it better!

Progress updates are tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/RISC-OS-Community/projects/6/views/1).

## Repository organization

This repository is organised in multiple "levels":

* [Resources List](doc/RISCOSCodingResources.md) - Links collection ala Awesome Resources style, to documentations, code snippets and info on Coding on RISC OS and for RISC OS.
* [Forums](doc/RISCOSCodingForums.md) where to ask questions related to code on RISC OS.
* Useful [Code Snippets](src), which are organised by programming language and features.
* [Ideas and suggestions for mini courses](doc/RISCOSCodingVideosIdeas.md) relative to Coding on RISC OS (and for RISC OS) videos for our YouTube channel.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to help us to improve this repository and the resources list (as well as proposing more ideas for the meetings!). Also, we are always seeking for people willing to provide courses, presentations and/or sharing your experience coding on RISC OS.
