# Tweet notifications

name: Notify twitter of new Push to main branch

on:

  # Paolo's note: Run on Pull requests merged to main only.
  #               It's a weird syntax, but, because a Pull Request always
  #               generates a "push" event when it gets merged, and given 
  #               that we do not commit directly to main, we can use the
  #               syntax below and it will result on creating a tweet on
  #               our twitter ONLY when a Pull Request from Develop branch
  #               gets merged into Main branch, which is what we want.
  push:
    branches: 
      - main

  # Paolo's note: Run when manually triggered.
  #               Because there are situations when we may need to trigger
  #               it manually, I just added this option. Please do not abuse
  #               of it :)
